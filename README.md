## Mission Statement

One of the biggest challenges in software development is finding out what should be implemented. Every single one of us has had at least one project that was on the verge of getting canceled because of massive misunderstandings amongst the people involved.  
 
Abstract descriptions can be interpreted differently, assumptions are made individually and there could be information missing, which leads to misunderstandings and conflicts. Thatâ€™s why we believe that using concrete examples in Given-When-Then for the desired behavior is crucial to get out of these recurring conflicts.  
But having these concrete examples is only one part. They must also be continuously validated against the implemented software solution with use of automation to be sure everything is working as expected.  
 
We aim to make it easier for teams to get started with formulating examples and formulating them in a way that gets them out of the uncertainty given they implemented the right thing. 
 
These are some of the methods and approaches we have identified that contribute to our efforts: 

	- Make people aware that there is a way to make their lives easier 
	- Improving SpecFlow and the tools around it to make them easier to use and understandable 
	- Show ways to use concrete examples in requirement analysis  
	- Make it easier to automate software solutions 
 
Everybody can contribute to accomplish our mission as it is equally a people problem as it is a technical problem we want to solve here. Therefore, anything that looks like a bugfix, feature, uncovered bug, example, explanation, guidance, content, or mentoring is welcomed and makes you part of our community.
